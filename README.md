A visually interactive Tableau dashboard for analyzing **BnB property listings**. This project provides insights into property pricing, availability, host activity, and geographic trends based on real-world listing data.

## 📌 Overview

This dashboard was created to explore patterns in short-term rental listings. Using **Tableau**, I built an interactive visual experience to help users:

- Explore pricing trends across neighborhoods
- Analyze host activity and availability
- View geographic distribution of listings
- Understand market density and competition

> 🔍 Built with real-world data and designed for usability, trend discovery, and business decision support.
